I’m an enthusiastic creative developer and dedicated team player.  I have a proven track record as a developer on various school and work projects.  
These projects showcase the flexibility of my skills as both a Web Developer and Digital Media Developer.  
Throughout each project, I challenge myself to find innovative ways to improve the user experience and yet still maintain its intuitiveness for the end user.
<br /><br />
My biggest passion is to work on projects that push the limits on creativity and innovation, where I can utilize my development skills as well as cultivate new ones along the way.  
This is especially important for me, as I remain committed to working on projects until they are completed.  
As a result, my communication and time management skills have drastically improved over time with the necessity of meeting deadlines and completing projects on time in group situations.  
Even for solo projects, I manage to collaborate with peers, professors, and business managers to get feedback on my projects and allowing me to take them to the next level in both functionality and design.

Notable projects include: the website for <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project/perle-systems/">Perle Systems</a></em>, a premier provider of reliable, 
full-featured and competitively priced serial, I/O, Ethernet and fiber connectivity solutions; 
<em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project/audible-shapes/">Audible Shapes</a></em>, a 3D generative music visualizer which allows users to create music with their 
hands through Unity, Max/MSP, and Leap Motion; and the website for <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project/perle-systems/">Da Capo</a></em>, a Toronto-based piano school

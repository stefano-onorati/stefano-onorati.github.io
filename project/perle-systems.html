<em>Perle Systems</em> is a manufacturer of reliable, full-featured and competitively priced Serial to Ethernet, Fiber to Ethernet, I/O Connectivity and Device Networking Hardware.
<br /><br />
The main task that was to be completed during my time at <em>Perle Systems</em> was to convert web pages to responsive design on main and language sites. <em>Perle Systems</em> currently operates and maintains five sites in different languages, including Italian, French, German, and Spanish. To accomplish a full responsive design across all five sites, a consistent and simple look-- feel was needed.
<br /><br />
We created and applied different templates with Bootstrap elements for all pages such that consistency was met throughout each site and each individual page on each site.  As well, I edited and cleaned up front-end code on web pages for existing bugs and design consistency across similar pages in case a page didnâ€™t have the same look-and-feel across all five sites. As well, I was responsible for implementing the new API for the PrintFriendly function on site to make web pages friendly to print.
<br /><br />
Smaller tasks that I worked and completed on include translating meta-information and content text from English to Italian for the Italian site; testing contact, product and warranty registration, and technical support forms on all sites for quality assurance and consistency; and searching for any orphaned pages to clean up space on remote and main server of the website.

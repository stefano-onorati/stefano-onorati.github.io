<em>Bicycle Race</em> is an interactive racing game which focuses on the issue of PED use in cycling. The game utilizes the bicycle as the main controller for users to race in the game, which is connected to the computer through Arduino computing and communicates with Unity3D.
<br /><br />
The objective is quite simple in <em>Bicycle Race</em>: the user bikes their way to victory and win the race. However, they are faced with a complex problem with significant consequences; in order to win the race, the user must take performing-enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage and increase the likelihood of winning the race. The user wins if they are not caught; otherwise, they must prepare for public scrutiny. However, if the user chooses not to ruin their reputation by taking drugs, they can race without giving in to peer pressure. This tackles the issue of PED use that is very prominent in the sport of cycling today, and presents the challenges these athletes face and fear about.

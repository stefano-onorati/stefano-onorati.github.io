The <em>Improv Soirée Visualizer</em> was one of several music visualizers developed by students for the Improv Soirée at York University in November 2014. The visualizers were displayed live in front of a small audience, and visually complemented the improv music performances.
<br /><br />
My version of the <em>Improv Soirée Visualizer</em> generates spheres of various sizes to signify volume and decaying in size over time, along with frequency lines above and below the spheres. The visualizer receives audio input and sends this information to Processing to change the size of the spheres and frequency lines in the sketch. Using touchOSC, certain visual properties of the spheres and lines, such as colour, stroke, and decay rate, were altered during the live improv performances.

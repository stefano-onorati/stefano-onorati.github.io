The <em>Interactive Video Gallery (IVG) Weather</em> is an interactive art piece which displays weather information from various cities worldwide. Alongside Nabil and Will, we developed this project during the Spring term and created two components that worked off each other: the user interaction and the aesthetics.
<br /><br />
The main interaction of this piece is through Twitter using the hashtag #IVGYorku. Users can send a tweet using this hashtag while also including a valid city name. Once the tweet is processed, the city name is validated in the program and is compared with each city name contained in the program's stored array of 40 cities from around the world. If a match is made, a message containing the city name is sent out to the visuals to update the weather information for the newly-chosen city. Relevant information displayed through these visuals include time of day, temperature, and wind direction and speed.

<em>Audible Shapes</em> is a 3D generative music visualizer. It allows the user to create a unique soundscape and manipulate objects within a 3D space. These objects will then generate sound and in combination create a piece of music or sound art. The user will simply use their hands for creating the objects, giving them a sense of familiarity and simplicity. The mixture of sound and interaction will create an immersive and enjoyable environment for anyone to create music.

Primarily, I focused on the user interaction aspect of <em>Audible Shapes</em>. I had to think outside the box when it came to developing in Unity in conjunction with the Leap Motion. I experimented with a wide range of gestures and how they could be used to create and manipulate sound in our project. As well, I had to take consideration as to how to make the gestures as intuitive for the average user as possible. Whether it'd be mapping certain movements to certain sound manipulations or labelling hand gestures in the environment, there was a heavy focus on making Audible Shapes intuitive and easy for anyone to control.

This was my final project for the Digital Media program at York University. <a href="http://victorzohni.com/" target="_blank">Victor Zohni</a> and I spent the entire school year working on this from start to finish, with the main goal of allowing anyone to play music just by using their hands regardless of what musical experience they have or lack in.

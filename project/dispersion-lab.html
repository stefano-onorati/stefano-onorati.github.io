Founded in 2015 by <a href="http://dvntsea.com/" target="_blank">Doug van Nort</a>, the DisPerSion Lab is a research lab for the Digital Media program at York University. It is dedicated to research-creation projects which examine questions surrounding instrumental and gestural expression, embodied perception, time consciousness and performative agency in the context of envisioning new forms of interdisciplinary creative practice.

The backbone of the site was previously built using Weebly, so my main focus for this project was to customize the front-end design of the site. I had discussed with Doug van Nort as to what colour scheme to use and what design changes to make. I also implemented my own code for improving the People page, which included the style of each bio/image combination and the behaviour of opening and closing bios on this page through JavaScript. As well, the page was customized to become responsive, changing how many images to display per line.

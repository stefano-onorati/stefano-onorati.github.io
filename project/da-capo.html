<em>Da Capo</em> is a piano school based in Toronto, where children and adults can learn both piano and theory.
<br /><br />
The website was built using Bootstrap as the backbone to its functionality. The website's appearance was customized in order to be simplistic for the teacher to navigate through and also to appear engaging to current and potential students of <em>Da Capo</em> to use. The website is also responsive for desktops and mobile devices, which makes it aesthetically pleasing regardless of what device you're using.
<br /><br />
Currently, the website is periodically updated to inform students of important dates, such as holidays and exam periods, and to post photos from the annual Tunes in June Concert, featuring performances from most students of <em>Da Capo</em>.
